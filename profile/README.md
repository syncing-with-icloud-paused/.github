iCloud sync can pause for various reasons, including:

### 1. **Low Battery Mode**
Apple devices automatically limit background processes, including iCloud sync, when Low Power Mode is enabled. If your battery is below 20%, this could be the culprit.

### 2. **Poor Internet Connection**
iCloud requires a stable Wi-Fi or cellular connection to sync properly. If your network is slow or unstable, syncing may be paused.

### 3. **Insufficient iCloud Storage**
If your iCloud storage is full, syncing will stop. Apple offers 5GB of free storage, which can fill up quickly with photos, videos, and backups.

### 4. **Signed Out of iCloud**
If you recently changed your Apple ID password or signed out of iCloud, syncing may be paused until you log back in.

### 5. **Apple Server Issues**
Sometimes, Apple’s iCloud servers experience downtime, causing sync delays. You can check Apple’s **System Status** page to see if there’s a known issue.

## How to Fix "Syncing with iCloud Paused"

Now that we know why this happens, let’s look at some solutions to get iCloud syncing again.

### 1. **Disable Low Power Mode**
